      <h2>When I was Stuck on Something Simple</h2>
      <p>
        I’d say the simplest problem I was stuck on this week was during the
        javascript-kata suite 2 challenge. I was having a rough time with the
        syntax of the part where I had to add the children to the children
        object, and assign it to Terah. The way I cracked it definitely relied
        on the rubber duck method discussed in the unit. I realised that I was
        basically just creating a new object with a value ben, instead of using
        curly brackets to add the actual ben object. When saying what I wanted
        the code to do aloud, I realised exactly what the issue was because that
        line didn’t make sense when turning the code into a sentence. I was
        really frustrated because I was certain everything looked right, and the
        console log looked super similar to what it was trying to get me to
        input, but once I figured everything out I was really stoked. I learnt
        the value of using console log to test stuff out, as well as a lot of
        helpful stuff about the correct brackets and such to use in situations
        thanks to all the stuff I googled trying to figure it out.
      </p>
      <h2>When I Nailed a Problem</h2>
      <p>
        I definitely had the smoothest and quickest solution for the flip flop
        and super flip flop challenges. The only change I had to make to my
        first attempt at a solution was realising that I would want to have the
        higher modular operators at the top of the function. I figured that one
        out with common sense in thinking that things divisible by 15 will
        always be divisible by 3 and/or 5. This one made me feel really good,
        especially coming off of struggling somewhat needlessly with the
        previous challenge. I felt like this one really cemented my
        understanding of the modular, I probably like 60% got it before this,
        but this really locked it in.
      </p>
      <h2>How I Feel About Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
      <p>
        I definitely feel good about using all of these problem-solving
        approaches. I’ve definitely done a considerable amount more of each of
        these things after learning about them, I’d say I was most surprised
        about the helpfulness of the rubber duck method, I ended up using that
        alot this sprint. I would say the ones I need to use more would be the
        ones about asking for help, I didn’t really get stuck to the point of
        needing to, but I should put some practice into doing it so I feel more
        comfortable to ask.cd
