        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence, measured by EQ describes an individual's
          ability to perform several functions vital for mantaining a healthy
          mind. These functions include but are not limited to: Empathy,
          emotional regulation, communication/collaboration, and exploration of
          the self.
        </p>
        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          EQ is different to IQ in that IQ is a flat measure of ability to
          perform in tasks. Most Iq tests measure an individual’s performance
          answering complex questions that often involve mathematics, reading
          comprehension and context-based elements. These questions are designed
          to test the flexibility and fortitude of your mind when it comes to
          tackling questions that often require input from multiple areas of the
          mind. This can be a good measure of someone's working ability for
          challenges based purely on intelligence. EQ on the other hand,
          measures our ability to understand ourselves and others. This ability
          is a crucial part of what makes up someone’s overall intelligence.
          Another important difference of EQ is that it is significantly easier
          to work on than IQ. While not impossible, most research suggests that
          IQ is based on several developmental and early-life factors, and
          mature individuals' IQ does not tend to fluctuate much over time. EQ
          however, can be provably trained by employing many different methods.
          Practices of mindfulness, like meditation or journaling can help us
          understand more about ourselves, and the people around us, and how
          best to approach things that we've previously struggled with. Thinking
          about self-mastery allows us to consider why we feel the way we do
          about situations, and perhaps how we can alter the way we view
          negative stimulus.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is EQ Important?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is important in all walks of life. Funnily
          enough, everything gets easier when you feel happy, organised, and
          aware of things that could challenge that. It is also true that
          socialisation, collaboration, and teamwork are all important parts of
          our lives. In the very narrow example of the tech workspace, it
          doesn’t particularly matter if you are a genius coder if you struggle
          to communicate and work with a team. Something like coding requires
          clear dialogue between members of a team, which involves being able to
          consciously hear people out, retain their ideas, and work with them to
          build upon them further. The same is true of being able to confidently
          and politely express your ideas to others, for them in turn to hear
          you out. While many people point to the importance of Iq for things
          like managerial and coordinative positions, I would argue that Eq is
          important throughout all levels of any workplace, especially something
          like coding in a team.
