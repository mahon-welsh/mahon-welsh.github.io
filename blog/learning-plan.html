        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to have a high demand, flexible skill set in
          coding and development, in order to be as employable as I can be while
          also being able to make awesome things in my spare time! I want to be
          able to perform competently in different roles not only to be a
          valuable employee, but also so I can spread my wings and not box
          myself into one position.
        </p>
        <h2>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h2>
        <p>
          In terms of strengths, when I’m applying myself and giving myself a
          proper chance, I can normally apply and understand content pretty
          quickly. While I can definitely take in new information well, I
          struggle a lot with motivation, time management, focus, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I definitely want to put as much practice as I can into managing my
          time and planning my study effectively. I’ve typically never used
          planners or written anything down and just relied on memory and common
          sense for any kind of study. I’ve definitely found through my work at
          Dev that this is absolutely not feasible for this kind of learning. As
          such, I’m doing my best to stick with the organisational tools that
          Dev suggested, as well as figuring out what personal methods work best
          for me.
        </p>
        <h2>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        </h2>
        <p>
          A big worry of mine has always been letting down teammates in group
          activities, or being the weakest link. I’m committed to writing every
          date down, almost constantly having access to discord or other
          channels of communication, and pushing work I’m 100% confident in well
          before deadlines (in case anything goes wrong!). I’m also committed to
          be respectful of my fellow learners’ cultures, beliefs, interests, and
          identities. I’m also committed to using appropriate channels and means
          to ask for help, which is something I’ve been traditionally poor at,
          but Dev is a very welcoming space!
        </p>
        <h2>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>
          As it has been covered extensively, I’m aware that there are several
          ways to ask for help at Devacademy. Before asking for help, it’s best
          to go over the content again, as well as make sure there aren’t any
          obvious typos in my code. The next best bet is to check out the
          foundations helpdesk channel on discord, as it is likely that someone
          else will have already had a similar issue at some point. If I can’t
          find anything that helps me sort out my issue, then I can ask my home
          group, the foundations help desk, or a facilitator.
        </p>
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitation team to be respectful and kind to the
          learners at Devacademy. I expect that within my facilitator will keep
          our home group chat up to date with anything I’d need to know on the
          fly, or if there’s something important to attend (it’s up to me to
          keep up with my messages though!). I expect that within reason, at
          reasonable times during a work day that I’m able to shoot a brief
          question through to them, or let them know if there's some major issue
          with the work/in life that needs some kind of resolution.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h2>
        <p>
          My main other commitment throughout my week is my part-time job. I
          work in a lovely little kitchen in Khandallah called The Cashmere
          Lounge. I only have 2 shifts a week there, which are on average about
          3-5 hours. It’s not a huge commitment and I can definitely balance it
          with my coursework. It's just a bit hard to get a hold of me from
          about 6-10 pm on Wednesdays and fridays.

        <h1>My Learning Plan! (updated)</h1>
        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          My answer to this one hasn't changed heaps, I still want to have as
          flexible a skillset as possible so I can occupy all kinds of
          interesting roles throughout my career.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think bootcamp will be great for me as I definitely do far better
          with some kind of presupposed structure, over entirely self directed
          learning. Honestly in terms of limitations specific to bootcamp, I'm
          just a worried about my overall competency with some aspects of
          coding, especially the syntax.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Time management, as well as arriving on time will present some issues
          for me, but theres only one way to work on that! The other big issue I
          typically face is definitely staying up to date and not falling
          behind, luckily there's plenty of avenues to ask for help and admit
          when I'm struggling.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I definitely want to work on sticking to schedules and deadlines, I
          want to be more honest with myself when I'm slipping up or just not
          getting it, and actually feel comfortable addressing the issue.
        </p>
        <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
        <p>
          My expectations are much the same as they were for the foundations
          facilitators. My hope is that the campus will be a welcoming
          environment, and that the staff is commited to helping anyone who
          needs/asks.
        </p>
        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
          I hope to be a positive and uplifting member of the piwakawaka cohort.
          I hope that people feel comfortable talking to me about anything, or
          asking for my input about work. I also want to hold myself to a higher
          standard when it comes to staying on task, motivated, and focused. It
          is my goal to never jeopardize myself or other students by not doing
          what is asked of me, within the required time frames.
