      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I struggled to come up with an example but I reckon the best one is as
        follows. I used to be very close to a particular group of friends, back
        before I really came out of my shell I relied on interaction with that
        group. As I started to come into my own more I realised that those
        people made me miserable and we never really had any fun together.
        Admittedly, I parted ways from this group after doing some unkind stuff,
        which I regret to this day. With that considered, leaving that group of
        friends still taught me to seek out people who I value, and who value
        me. It also gave me valuable experience in making new connections, which
        provided me much needed confidence.

      <h2>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have spent a lot of time with many different groups and different
        types of people growing up. I feel like I’ve taken bits and pieces from
        all of these different connections to form a well rounded and accepting
        mindset. I’ve spent time hanging around all kinds of delinquents, to
        mainly associating with academics. What I’ve come to find is that
        everyone has a story, everyone has their strengths, and everyone has
        something that makes them special.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would say one of my strengths is sociability. I find it easy to
        connect with people and always enjoy hearing more about them. As such, I
        find myself far more committed and capable of meeting deadlines and
        requirements if I’m putting in that effort for others. I also believe I
        have a pretty quick mind, and if I manage to remove myself from
        distractions, then I can be an extremely capable and efficient learner.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have ADHD + Autism, meaning that generally being quick to things comes
        with its fair share of challenges. I definitely struggle with
        procrastination, self motivation, focus and willpower. However, I hope
        to work on managing these things through our learning in the human
        skills units!
      </p>
      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The main group work I have experienced has been stuff in highschool,
        which always came to some circumstance where no one was willing to do
        the work or communicate. Back then, just doing all of it was easy, and
        often a way to make some money off of the people in my group. However,
        Devacademy will obviously provide challenging and unfamiliar group work
        where this strategy will not work. I’ve become a far more cooperative
        person since then, and I look forward to working with groups where
        interaction, planning and communication are encouraged.
