    <h2>How Does JS Relate to HTML and Css?</h2>
    <div class="examples">
      Javascript is a language of action. We can use Javascript to do all kinds
      of things to HTML elements, such as editing them, or allowing them to be
      recognized by different functions. In JS, we can call apon different CSS
      classes and ids to "get" different elements, which we can use to make our
      functions widely applicable.
    </div>
    <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
    <div class="examples">
      "Control Flow" is the order that your computer runs all of the stuff in
      your script. Basically, items in JS run in order from the first line to
      the last line. However, specific items like functions or loops change
      this. A function may occur only if a specific requirement was not met, for
      example the submit button on a form may have a conditional structure,
      where if a required field is left blank, a specific part of the code runs
      to display a message prompting the user to answer that section. Functions
      could also call to a different section of the script, which would affect
      the control flow. With loops, they run anything within them the specified
      amount of times, which could in turn call other functions multiple times
      too.
    </div>
    <h2>The DOM</h2>
    <div class="examples">
      The DOM is an interface for web documents that represents the content of
      the document as a tree. This tree is populated by different nodes (all the
      content). We can manipulate the DOM to in turn effect the associated CSS
      or HTML elements on the page. We can interact with the DOM by using
      devtools, which allows us to easily find the specific html elements, then
      change them, and add classes or ids. We can also use the DOM for JS
      applications such as creating events and forms by using the console.
    </div>
    <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
    <div class="examples">
      An object contains a list of "Key Value Pairs". These are kind of like a
      video game character's stats. When accessing data from them, we would
      refer to the name of the key, then get back whatever value may be
      associated to that key. This could be useful if you were collecting
      data/values of a bunch of different people, like customers, you're
      collecting the same different bits of info for each person (name, age,
      address, etc), but the value is different between different people. In a
      case like this, you would wantSata back. This is obviously more useful for
      things. For instance, if i wanted to access a list of ages from all these
      customers that I've now collected, I could use a function that returns an
      array of age values for each client, which I could then target specific
      ages from by using their place in the list.
    </div>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <div class="examples">
      Functions are essentially a list of statements that do something. A
      function takes some kind of input, and returns an output associated with
      said input. For example, a function could take 2 numbers and add them
      together, or add text a user writes to an element on the page. Functions
      also play a crucial role in objects being manipulated with events, given
      that you have to have a function associated with an event, and a function
      that listens for the event.
