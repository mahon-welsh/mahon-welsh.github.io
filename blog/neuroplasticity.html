      <h1>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h1>
      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the idea that our brains are malleable and extremely
        capable of developing new connections. The basic concept is as follows;
        when practicing or learning things, we develop pathways of neurons that
        fire when doing that specific thing. With repeated use of these neural
        pathways, they get stronger, and more streamlined. Eventually our brains
        have these networks of neurons that fire for specific tasks and
        knowledge. Interestingly, if tasks or recall happen to be associated,
        they will have a neural pathway connecting them, and if one of those
        neurons happens to fire, then the connected neurons are also likely to
        go off. What this means for us is that when doing things, we are
        actively strengthening neural connections in our brain, meaning that by
        consistently thinking about and doing a thing, such as coding, our brain
        will form stronger pathways, which increases the chance of all the
        neurons associated with coding to fire, which in turn makes recall and
        execution more efficient. There are many, many ways to increase
        neuroplasticity, some studies have even found video games to have a
        positive effect. Some games require problem solving, while some require
        puzzle solving and context clues. In terms of more tangible intentional
        ways to encourage neuroplasticity,

          one particularly useful source

        I found offered 9 techniques: Specific diet choices, power naps, not
        working for too long, working on vocabulary, practice with non-dominant
        hand, juggling, learning chess, mnemonic drills, and group meditation.

      <h2>The Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p>
        A “fixed mindset” refers to the idea that basic abilities and natural
        talents are fixed, while obviously people can learn new things, a fixed
        mindset suggests that one's aptitude for learning and retaining
        information cannot be shaped. On the contrary, a “growth mindset” is
        exactly how it sounds. The growth mindset focuses on the process, the
        idea is to care more about how to solve something than the innate
        ability to do so. The growth mindset encourages rewards and praise
        focused on the method and show of resilience rather than praising the
        actual outcome. In Carol Dweck’s ted talk she discusses how she worked
        with a team to create a maths learning game that focuses on the growth
        mindset. It gives encouragement for effort, strategy and progress,
        rather than when a correct answer is submitted. This game showed
        significantly higher rates of engagement and perseverance than other
        similar learning tools. The idea of the yet vs the now is important in
        the growth mindset. When facing a challenge, don’t think “I’ve failed”,
        think “I can’t do this yet. This encourages the idea that we can gain
        capability, and allows us to focus more on the process and trying new
        solutions. Something I found interesting about this is that the growth
        and fixed mindsets are attributed to specific parts of life. For
        instance, with my coding skills, I’ve unconsciously developed a strong
        growth mindset, whereas with skateboarding, I feel like I’ve always had
        a fixed mindset, thinking that some people are just born more
        coordinated and fearless. In terms of my work, I plan to consciously
        consider the growth mindset when stuck or having difficulties, and take
        a step back to remind myself that it’s not an “I can’t do this”, it’s an
        “I can’t do this, yet” situation.

      <h2>In Relation to my Learning Plan</h2>
      <p>
        Since I used to study psychology, the idea of neuroplasticity was
        already familiar to me, and something that I’ve always tried to
        apply/work on. However the concept of a growth mindset was new to me. I
        think my biggest takeaway from this is that some of my limitations
        aren’t as rigid as I thought. Given I’m neurodiverse, I’ve always
        thought that focus and time blindness were just inherent issues for me.
        However, if I were to apply a combination of neuroplasticity concepts
        and a growth mindset, then I can make realistic steps to improve
        something that I have predetermined difficulty with.
