      <h2>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I feel like I’ve learnt alot about different personal triggers for anger
        and frustration, and how to best mitigate these things. I also feel like
        I’ve done a lot of thinking about settings and stimulus around me to get
        into my most productive state. Lastly, I feel a lot less embarrassed
        about feeling incompetent, or ‘behind’ my peers. I understand that
        there's lots to learn and even if I feel like I’m not doing the greatest
        job, the only way to get better is to keep coding, and keep not knowing
        stuff.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        As the human skills units have reiterated, a great member of a team is
        someone who can elevate the vibe of the people around them. I feel like
        values are important in that having strong values is bound to rub off on
        teammates. Holding value in ideas like collaboration, openness, helping
        out others, etc is likely to encourage a team where everyone feels
        comfortable working with one another, which allows for much more shit to
        get done! Empathy and self-awareness also play an important role, it’s
        important to not just be kind and accommodating to others in a team, but
        also to be capable of giving yourself the same treatment. If you can’t
        be kind to yourself, every minor issue or roadblock becomes far more of
        a struggle.
      </p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Since I have a background in psych, I definitely thought that there was
        going to be less for me to learn in the Human skills units. However,
        there were heaps of cool resources to check out! While I definitely did
        already know about plenty of the concepts we covered, there was some
        stuff, or some perspectives on these concepts that were completely new
        to me.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        While not super challenging, I’d say the most strenuous part was
        actually putting the knowledge into practice. I found myself consciously
        using techniques such as self-mastery and awareness when approaching
        frustration not just with course work, but other aspects of my life. The
        other slightly difficult one to keep on top of was trying to write more
        detailed journal entries. Brief notes about my day or days coming up is
        something I’ve done for years at this point, but then taking the time to
        go back and assign understanding to how I feel about things has been
        really helpful, just easy to forget to keep in the habit of.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think it’s important because a lot of people with an interest in
        something like coding/web development are known for being less social
        people. I think it’s important to encourage an environment like Dev
        where everyone feels safe to reach out and just have yarns in general.
        The other big reason that I feel like the Human skills stuff is
        important to cover is how easy it is to get frustrated with something
        like coding. It’s really valuable to have techniques and concepts to
        help out with these negative feelings, and how to bounce back from some
        evil-ass code mental block.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I don’t think that Human skills learning felt like a waste of time. I
        felt like I got plenty of value out of it despite being very familiar
        with some of the learning such as the content on neuroplasticity. I
        think that the content, even if already known, serves as a great
        reminder to uphold the principles we covered. I feel like reminding
        myself that it’s ok to give myself a minute, that each time I do any
        coding I’m actively strengthening my brain's ability to think like a
        coder, among other things are really helpful to keep in mind.
